# communal-violence-data-analysis
Regression modelling of fractionalization and communal violence (cross-country analysis, Africa)

I test a series of hypotheses regarding the association between heterogeneity and the incidence and intensity of ethnic communal violence.
I use data from:
- ACLED 
- Wimmer et al. (2009)
- Alesina et al. (2003)
- Garcia-Montalvo et al. (2014)

Data cleaning and merging in R; regression modelling in Stata.
